# Advanced Use
## Coverage Export

With version 1.1 and clients 4.1, 3.1, 2.1 and maybe 1.1, we've introduced a new feature: coverage
export. With it, you can export all your tests' coverage (or a subset) into a file that can be read
by PHPUnit. This should be helpful when creating a combined coverage report from End-to-End tests
and Unit Tests.
