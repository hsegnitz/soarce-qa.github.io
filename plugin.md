# Plugin / Client
## Introduction
This package is the client part of SOARCE - a tool for collecting, reading and analyzing PHP
code coverage withing a service oriented architecture / microservice environment. It has to
be installed per service as a dev requirement. This library will intercept certain calls to
the service/application and either execute necessary code for collecting and storing coverage
before/after the actual application code or execute it's own actions instead.

### DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

Although there will be security measures in place, include this library only as a --dev
dependency. The intended use is local development or use within a CI/CD pipeline on dedicated
integration systems.

## Installation
### composer.json
```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "soarce/client": "*"
    }
}
```
or preferably run this composer command in your project root:

```
$ composer require --dev --prefer-dist "soarce/client"
```

In addition, you will have to install and enable xdebug in order to generate code coverage.
It has not been included in the "required" section as it would disallow composer-runs
without it.


## Configuration

### ENV-Variables
* string `SOARCE_ACTION_PARAM_NAME` = "SOARCE": names the SOARCE interceptor param
  name. Use something long and random to obfuscate an active SOARCE client if necessary
  and/or to solve parameter name conflicts with your application. It has to match the
  main application's parameter name setting.
* string `SOARCE_APPLICATION_NAME` = $_SERVER['HOSTNAME']: names the server/application
  for gathering the stats. This should be the same name used in the main application's
  config. As a fallback the "HOSTNAME" server variable will be used - with docker this
  means defaulting to the docker container's id.
* string `SOARCE_DATA_PATH` = "/tmp/": any writable location on your server / in your
  container. Named pipes, trigger and pid-files will be written there. If you host
  multiple services from the same host or container, make sure they use different
  `SOARCE_DATA_PATH`s. Coverage is sent directly to the master application, trace is
  written to the named pipes, parsed in memory and the result then sent to the master.
* string `SOARCE_WHITELISTED_HOST_IPS` = "": a comma-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses that should be able to access SOARCE commands and resources through this
  plugin. The empty default means no whitelisting active and permits all requests.
  This is the default as SOARCE is a development tool and should not be accessible from
  public networks anyways.
* string `SOARCE_WHITELISTED_PATHS` = "": a PATH_SEPARATOR (:) separated list of paths
  out of which SOARCE is allowed to handout sourcecode on request - to display in code
  coverage views. You should include all possible source code and library paths - a
  good start is usually the `common_path` parameter in the application's config, for
  example "/var/www". As with the IP whitelist, an empty path whitelist disables the
  feature as SOARCE should only be used in closed environments.
* string `SOARCE_PRESHARED_SECRET` = "": an arbitrary string which - if used - has to
  be identical to the respective config key in the application's config. It is being
  sent as a HTTP header to effectively reduce drive-by or XSS attacks as well as
  brute-force attempts to guess how to access SOARCE on a certain system.

### X-Debug

```ini
xdebug.auto_trace = 0
xdebug.trace_format = 1
xdebug.trace_enable_trigger = 0
```
                
This is counterintuitive, but, SOARCE triggers coverage and tracing itself.


### docker-compose

Currently the client expects a few preconditions at static hostnames/addresses - we
plan to add configuration options later:

* the main application will be expected at the address "http://soarce.local:80/"
* the redis server (for reliable mutex locking of the pipes) at
  "tcp://soarce.local:6379"
* clone the application [soarce/application](https://gitlab.home.segnitz.net/soarce/application)
  and run `docker-compose up` for it, it will create and run the necessary services
  within a virtual network.
* make sure that the containers you install this package to can access the
  aforementioned services. This can be achieved for example by running them with
  docker-compose and putting them into the same virtual network:
  * for your application container (e.g. php-fpm or apache + mod_php) add a new
    network to the current one so it looks for example like this:
    ```yaml
    services:
      my-app:
        build: [...]
        volumes: [...]
        links: [...]
        networks:
          default:
            aliases:
              - my-app.local
            soarce_default:
    ```
  * define the network `soarce_default` as an external network by adding this to
    the end of your docker-compose.yml:
    ```yaml
    networks:
      soarce_default:
        external: true
    ```

## Debug Interface

Just call the index page of your application - e.g. `/` or `/index.php` and add
`?SOARCE=index` to the call.

This will only work without the security measures in place.


## Known Issues

### Security

* Component requires xdebug to be active
* **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!**

### Separating Requests
For within a service architecture we just added a feature that automatically
detects the request-id of the parent request and the sequence number of child
requests within that parent request.

This currently only works in it's zero-conf mode when each service is running
in it's own VM or docker container - having a separate IP address - and without
having gaps in between - like load balancers or services not equipped with an
active SOARCE client. We'll add additional support options in the future.
